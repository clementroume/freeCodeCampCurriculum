# FreeCodeCamp Curriculum Progress

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I share my projects and progress as I follow the [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) curriculum. This repository contains my solutions to the various challenges and projects provided by FreeCodeCamp, organized by the different sections of the curriculum.

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to documenting my learning journey through FreeCodeCamp. I am working on projects in a variety of fields, ranging from responsive web design to JavaScript algorithms, to APIs and microservices. My goal is to learn by doing and to share my knowledge with the community.

## Ongoing Projects

I am currently working on Responsive Web Design section and will update this repository as I make progress.
